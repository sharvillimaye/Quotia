Good morning, John. I’ve reviewed your recent test results, and it appears that you have hypertension, or high blood pressure. This means that your blood pressure is consistently above the normal range, which can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other complications.

Oh, I see. I didn’t realize my blood pressure was that high. What can I do about it?

We’re going to start with a medication called Amlodipine, which will help lower your blood pressure. You’ll take one 5 mg tablet daily. Along with this, I recommend making some lifestyle changes. Reducing sodium in your diet, exercising regularly, and managing stress can help lower your blood pressure over time.

How long will I need to take this medication?

Likely for the foreseeable future, but we’ll monitor your blood pressure regularly to see how you’re responding. If your levels stabilize and stay within the normal range, we might consider adjusting the dosage or exploring other options.

What are the potential side effects of Amlodipine?

Common side effects include swelling in the feet and ankles, dizziness, or fatigue. Let us know if you experience any of these, and we’ll evaluate if a different medication is needed.

What happens if I don’t manage my blood pressure?

Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to serious health problems, such as heart attacks, strokes, or kidney damage. That’s why it’s essential to take these steps seriously.

Understood. Thank you for explaining it to me.
